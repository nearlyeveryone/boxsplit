# boxsplit
A webapp with the goal of connecting weebs from all over together in order to help out with merchandise splitting
## The Box
A box is what we call the overarching order that contains the merchandise inside of it. Typically one person will buy this box then reach out to other people who are interested in **splitting** the cost for some other piece of merchandise. Normally it would be by favorite character in a series
## The Split
A split is an individual order/reservation made within a box by one person. A box contains multiple splits.
## The Money
We have zero intentions of having anything to do with anything mercantile, like facilitating shipping and PayPal payments. boxsplit is meant to be a place for people to find splits on. Payments will be left to the individual Box owners and their Splits. ~~Boxers and Splitters?~~
